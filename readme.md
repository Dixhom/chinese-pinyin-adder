# Chinese Pinyin Adder

This is an app to add pinyin to Chinese texts.

Sometimes it's hard for Chinese learners to look up pronunciation of every single hanzi on a dictionary. This app checks it up for you. In case you want to paste Chinese texts with pronunciation rubies on your website, it provides hanzi and pinyin in ruby tags.
